# login-react-native
A starter repository for creating a login page in react native.

This project contains:
1. 60fps animations using MOTI that uses Reanimated under the hood.
2. Uses third party package for fade-in carousel effect.
3. And a bit of inspiration and designing from other devs.


For running this project in you machine simply:
1. git clone <this repo url>
2. Open the folder
3. npm install
4. npx react-native start
5. npx react-native run-android (usually I skip step 4)
6. Enjoy!
